Hassan Yusuf

Software Engineer based in London.

I currently work at Cloudhouse, building and improving C# .NET packaging technology that enables legacy applications to run on modern systems. My work focuses on virtual machine analysis, packaging workflows, and CI/CD automation across the full development lifecycle.

Previously at The Access Group, I contributed to the Direct Debit Central Management System (DDCMS), used by organisations such as Eon Energy and Cineworld. I also developed internal applications using .NET, React and GraphQL, and built CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps.

I focus on writing clean, maintainable, and well-structured code — prioritising simplicity, readability, and long-term reliability.
